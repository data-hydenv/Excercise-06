Exercise 6 (PostgreSQL) for the data course 2020

**This exercises is meant to be solved by the whole class. Do not solve it individually.**

You are free to organize yourself into sub-groups for each task. Everyone has to participate, but not everyone has to solve every task. Sign up to github and use the tools available to efficiently collaborate.

A *possible* workflow could look like:

1. Split into developer-teams of three persons
2. [Create a new branch](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-branches) of the repo using a fancy team name *Note*: do not use names that start with ``master`` or ``clean-``.
3. [Push to that branch](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository) whatever necessary
4. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) from your branch into master
5. Before accepted, you need at least two [reviews of the suggested changes](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews). Everyone in the students group is allowed to write such a code review. You can also assign someone as a refereee, or mention someone in a discussion about changes. The two instructors names on github are ``@mmaelicke`` and ``@modche``
6. Finally, [merge](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-merges) the changes into master. 

You can create as many branches as you need. When finished, plese clean up all you branches by deleting them **after** merged into the master branch. Only a ``master`` and a ``clean-*`` branch should be left.

Github offers so called projects and (sub)-team, which if used can make any decision making within the group fairly transparent.
