# Task 4

In this task you'll have to create various plots in RMarkdown.

## a)

Does the temperature show a location drift?

This is an important analysis for many spatial interpolation algorithms, as they often assume the varable to be independent of location.
That means, check if there is a relationship between the temperature and either coordiante dimension.  

## b)

Create a timeseries of all temperature measurements of this student generation. Plot the mean and median temperature by solid thick lines and indicate the variability of all sensors by a bounding area around the mean.
