## Load packages
Check if needed packages are installed and loaded.
```{r, echo=FALSE}

#if the installation of tmap package doesn't work like that, it has to be installed manually

## Connect to Server
```{r}

##Create view on hobos with temperature indices
```{sql connection=con}

```

#Take a look at the created view
```{sql connection=con}
SELECT * FROM indices
```

##Join districts with indices
```{sql connection=con}
SELECT name AS district,

  FROM (SELECT * FROM indices join districts on st_within(indices.geom, districts.geom)) AS test
  GROUP BY name
```

##Make map

### load data
#### indices
```{sql connection=con, output.var ="hobo"}
select id, hobo_id, year, mean_day, var_day, perc_90_day, mean_night, var_night, perc_90_night, st_asewkt(st_transform(geom, 25832)) as "UTM" 
from indices 
```
#### freiburg districts
```{sql connection=con, output.var="fr_dis"}
select id, name, st_asewkt(st_transform(geom, 25832)) as "UTM" 
from districts 
```
#### freiburg districts indices
```{sql connection=con, output.var = "fr_dis_indi"}
SELECT name,
  avg(mean_day) AS mean_day,
  avg(var_day) AS var_day,
  avg(perc_90_day) AS perc_90_day,
  avg(mean_night) AS mean_night,
  avg(var_night) AS var_night,
  avg(perc_90_night) AS perc_90_night
  FROM (SELECT * FROM indices join districts on st_within(indices.geom, districts.geom)) AS test
  GROUP BY name
```
### creat sf objects
```{r}
fr_dis_indi <- left_join(fr_dis_indi, fr_dis, by = c("name"))
fr_dis_indi_sf <- st_as_sf(fr_dis_indi, wkt = "UTM")
hobo_sf <- st_as_sf(hobo, wkt = "UTM")
fr_dis_sf <- st_as_sf(fr_dis, wkt = "UTM")
hobo_inter <- st_intersection(hobo_sf, fr_dis_sf)
```

### classification of the indices
The color-classes of the maps are calculated by the *Jenks-Caspall-algorithm* that try to minimize the differences within a class and maximize the differences between classes. For the districts and HOBO-series one common color-classification is chosen.
```{r}
class_breaks <- classIntervals(hobo_sf$mean_day, n = 5, style = "jenks")$brks
class_breaks3 <- classIntervals(hobo_sf$var_day, n = 5, style = "jenks")$brks
class_breaks5 <- classIntervals(hobo_sf$perc_90_day, n = 5, style = "jenks")$brks
class_breaks2 <- classIntervals(hobo_sf$mean_night, n = 5, style = "jenks")$brks
class_breaks4 <- classIntervals(hobo_sf$var_night, n = 5, style = "jenks")$brks
class_breaks6 <- classIntervals(hobo_sf$perc_90_night, n = 5, style = "jenks")$brks
```


### mean day map
```{r}
tm_shape(fr_dis_indi_sf) +
  tm_fill("mean_day", style = "jenks",  legend.show = F) +
  tm_borders() +
    tm_text("name", just = "center", size = 0.7, col = "black") +
tm_shape(hobo_inter) +
  tm_dots(col = "mean_day", shape = 21, size = 0.4, style = "jenks", 
          title = "Temp. [°C]") +
  tm_layout(title = "mean day")
   
```

##Selected indice
As the average day temperature is the most intuitive parameter, it was chosen for visualisation. It creates a good overview over the spatial distribution. However, there are several uncertainties influencing the average day temperature, like the exposition, shielding etc. Therefore, a combination of mean, variance and 90th percentile would show a more complete picture.

##Does the spatial aggregation to districts change the overall picture?
The overall picture is definitely changed by the spatial aggregation. The amount of hobos per district varies as well as the area of the different districts. Especially in large suburban district with few hobos, one outlier can dominate a large area. On the other hand, a lot of measurements took place in smaller districts in the city center, which might therefore be more reliable but only represent a small area.
