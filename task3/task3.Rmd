```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# install packages if missing
if (!("RPostgreSQL" %in% installed.packages())){
  install.packages("RPostgreSQL")
}
if (!("getPass" %in% installed.packages())){
  install.packages("getPass")
}

# load packages
require(RPostgreSQL)
require(getPass)

# establish the connection
drv <- dbDriver('PostgreSQL')
con <- dbConnect(drv, host='v45522.1blu.de', port=5432, user=getPass('Provide the user'), 
                 password=getPass('Provide the password'), dbname='datamanagement')
```

## Solution

The first part of the task is considered to be finished when the follwong query produces meaningful output:

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT * FROM indices
```

Additionally, add either a R chunk to produce the output map or include the map exported from QGis as an image file.


## Hints

There is also an aggregation function in PostgreSQL that can be used in <span style="color: blue">GROUP BY</span> statements.
The median of all temperatures avaiable in the table can be calculated like:
```{sql connection=con}
select percentile_cont(0.5) within group (order by temperature)
from raw_data
```

Remember that omitting the grouping statement will aggregate all records. Of course you can set a custom group by statement.
```{sql connection=con}
select
  hobo_id,
  percentile_cont(0.5) within group (order by temperature) as "Median"
from raw_data
GROUP BY hobo_id
```
