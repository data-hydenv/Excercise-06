# Task 1
Solve this task as a class. Look carefully into the raw_data table. Implement a suitable table for your qualitiy checked **temperature** data. 
Your data shall be linked to the hobo table and the raw_data table. That means, with a single <span style="color: blue;">JOIN</span> query it should be possible to load the hobo metadata and the corresponding raw_data record to each qaulity checked value. Do also implement the data quality information as normalized as possible.

The exercise is considered finished as soon as the example code in the [Exercise 6](https://github.com/data-hydenv/Excercise-06) repo works without errors and shows reasonable results.
